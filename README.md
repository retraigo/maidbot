# Maidbot

## This template no longer works.

A discord bot template made with `discordjs-commando`.

## How to use

=> Open https://discord.com/developers/applications/

=> Create a new application

=> Create a bot user for the application

=> Copy the bot token.


### How to host

=> have nodejs installed in your pc.

=> Clone this repo.

=> open the terminal at the bot's directory and run `npm install`.

=> open the config.js file and replace <TOKEN> with your bot's token.
  
=> run `node index` in the terminal.

### Things you can do to start developing your bot:

=> Check out https://discordjs.guide for a discord bot guide (tho the repo has basics covered)

=> Refer https://discord.js.org for documentation on `discord.js` and `discordjs-commando`.
